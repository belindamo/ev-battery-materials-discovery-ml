    "id": "ev-battery-ml-discovery",
    "title": "ML-Driven Discovery of EV Battery Materials",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models can effectively predict key electrochemical properties (voltage, capacity, cycle stability) of novel cathode and anode materials by learning from existing battery materials databases, enabling accelerated discovery of high-performance EV battery compositions. This research proposes a hybrid approach combining semantic embedding-based retrieval with physics-informed ML models to discover novel battery materials that outperform current standards while considering practical constraints like cost and availability.",
    "hypothesis": "Primary: Machine learning models can effectively predict key electrochemical properties of novel battery materials from existing databases. Secondary: Combining semantic embedding approaches with physics-informed constraints will outperform purely data-driven methods for battery material property prediction.",
    "relatedWork": "Current battery material discovery relies on time-consuming trial-and-error experimentation and first-principles computational methods. Recent materials informatics advances show ML can accelerate screening, predict properties without expensive DFT calculations, and guide synthesis. Gap: Most approaches focus on single-property prediction or lack integration with real-world constraints (cost, availability, toxicity).",
    "implementationPlan": "Three-phase approach: (1) Semantic Embedding-Based Discovery: Curate dataset from Materials Project and literature, generate embeddings using sentence-transformers, build FAISS index, implement LLM-based composition generation. (2) Structure-Property Prediction: Extract structural descriptors using pymatgen/matminer, train XGBoost models with nested cross-validation, perform feature importance analysis. (3) Hybrid Pipeline: Integrate both approaches with physics constraints, multi-objective optimization, deploy via Streamlit interface.",
    "evaluationPlan": "Success metrics include: MAE < 0.2V for voltage prediction, MAE < 20 mAh/g for capacity prediction, Precision@10 > 0.7 for novel recommendations, RÂ² > 0.85 for voltage and > 0.80 for capacity in structure-property models, overall system accuracy improvement, user satisfaction scores from materials scientist evaluations, novel material discovery rate validated via literature search, pipeline inference time < 1 second per query.",
    "successCriteria": "Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Curated dataset >10K materials, baseline models, initial validation. Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Optimized hybrid pipeline, Streamlit deployment, expert evaluation results. Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Novel material candidates with predicted properties, open-source toolkit, research paper draft and potential patent applications. Realistic outcome: Develop screening tool reducing experimental validation by 70%, identify 20-30 promising candidates, create open-source toolkit.",
    "risks": "Data Quality: Limited/biased training data (mitigate with cross-validation across databases, uncertainty quantification). Model Generalization: Poor performance on novel classes (domain adaptation, physics constraints). Experimental Validation: Predicted materials may not be synthesizable (synthesis feasibility scores, experimental collaboration). Computational Resources: Large-scale training requirements (pre-trained embeddings, optimized architectures, cloud computing).",
    "implications": "Scientific: Advance materials informatics for energy storage, demonstrate hybrid ML effectiveness, provide benchmark protocols. Practical: Accelerate EV battery development, reduce R&D costs, enable unconventional material exploration. Broader: Template for ML materials discovery, contribute to sustainable energy transition, open science tools for global community.",
