# ML-Driven Discovery of Novel EV Battery Materials

## Research Problem Statement

**Core Question**: Can machine learning models accelerate the discovery of high-performance cathode and anode materials for electric vehicle batteries by predicting electrochemical properties from compositional and structural features?

**Knowledge Gap**: Current battery material discovery relies heavily on empirical testing and incremental improvements to existing chemistries. The Materials Genome Initiative has generated vast computational and experimental datasets, but systematic ML approaches to identify entirely novel compositions with superior performance remain underexplored.

## Research Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis

**H1**: Multi-modal embeddings combining compositional data, crystal structure descriptors, and literature-extracted properties can predict battery material performance (voltage, capacity, cycle stability) more accurately than traditional computational methods alone.

### Secondary Hypotheses

**H2**: Retrieval-augmented generation using scientific literature embeddings will identify promising compositional spaces not extensively explored in current databases.

**H3**: Integrating economic constraints (raw material costs, abundance) during the discovery process will yield practically viable candidates with superior cost-performance ratios.

## Novel Methodological Approach

### Core Innovation

We propose a **knowledge-augmented materials discovery pipeline** that combines:

1. **Semantic embeddings** of battery literature (sentence-transformers on titles, abstracts, properties)
2. **Physics-informed feature engineering** from Materials Project descriptors
3. **Economic optimization** using real-time commodity pricing
4. **Uncertainty quantification** to prioritize experimental validation

### Technical Architecture

* **Data Layer**: Curated multi-source dataset (Materials Project, Battery Materials Database, ChemDataExtractor2)
* **Embedding Layer**: FAISS-indexed vector database for similarity search
* **Prediction Layer**: Ensemble of XGBoost (interpretable) + neural networks (complex interactions)
* **Decision Layer**: Multi-objective optimization (performance vs. cost vs. synthesis feasibility)
* **Validation Layer**: Integration with Materials Project Battery Explorer for computational verification

## Expected Impact

### Scientific Contribution

* **Methodological**: First systematic application of retrieval-augmented ML to materials discovery
* **Empirical**: Novel battery material candidates with quantified performance predictions
* **Theoretical**: Understanding of structure-property relationships across chemical space

### Field Transformation

* **Acceleration**: Reduce material discovery timeline from years to months
* **Democratization**: Open-source tools for smaller research groups
* **Integration**: Bridge computational materials science and practical battery engineering

## Risk Assessment & Validation Strategy

### Primary Risk

**Assumption**: Literature embeddings capture sufficient chemical intuition for property prediction
**Mitigation**: Benchmarking against known materials; ablation studies on embedding quality

### Validation Criteria

1. **Computational**: Prediction accuracy on held-out Materials Project data
2. **Literature**: Recovery of known high-performance materials in similarity searches
3. **Expert**: Evaluation by battery researchers for chemical plausibility
4. **Economic**: Cost projections validated against industry reports
