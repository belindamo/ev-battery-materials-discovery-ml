# Experiment Proposal: ML-Driven Discovery of EV Battery Materials

## Research Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: Machine learning models can effectively predict key electrochemical properties (voltage, capacity, cycle stability) of novel cathode and anode materials by learning from existing battery materials databases, enabling accelerated discovery of high-performance EV battery compositions.

**Secondary Hypothesis**: Combining semantic embedding approaches with physics-informed constraints will outperform purely data-driven methods for battery material property prediction.

## Literature Context

Current battery material discovery relies heavily on trial-and-error experimentation and first-principles computational methods, both of which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recent advances in materials informatics suggest that ML approaches can:

1. **Accelerate screening**: Reduce the search space from millions of potential compositions to hundreds of promising candidates
2. **Predict properties**: Estimate key metrics (voltage, capacity, stability) without expensive DFT calculations
3. **Guide synthesis**: Suggest synthesis pathways for novel compositions

**Gap in existing work**: Most current approaches focus on single-property prediction or lack integration with real-world constraints (cost, availability, toxicity).

## Experimental Design

### Experiment 1: Semantic Embedding-Based Material Discovery

**Objective**: Develop a retrieval-augmented system for battery material property prediction using semantic embeddings.

**Variables**:
- Independent: Material composition, crystal structure, synthesis conditions

**Method**:
1. Curate dataset from Materials Project, Battery Materials Database, and literature
2. Generate embeddings using sentence-transformers on material descriptions and properties
3. Build FAISS index for similarity search
4. Implement LLM-based composition generation with retrieved context
5. Validate predictions against Materials Project Battery Explorer

**Success Metrics**:
- MAE < 0.2V for voltage prediction

### Experiment 2: Structure-Property Prediction Model

**Objective**: Train XGBoost model to predict battery material properties from structural descriptors.

**Variables**:
- Features: Atomic properties, crystal structure descriptors, electronic features

**Method**:
1. Extract structural descriptors using pymatgen and matminer
2. Feature engineering: atomic descriptors, crystal structure features, electronic properties
3. Train XGBoost models with nested cross-validation
4. Feature importance analysis and model interpretation
5. Benchmark against baseline models (linear regression, random forest)

**Success Metrics**:

### Experiment 3: Hybrid Retrieval-Prediction Pipeline

**Objective**: Combine semantic search with physics-informed ML for comprehensive material discovery.

**Variables**:
- Pipeline components: Embedding model, similarity threshold, prediction model weights
- Integration strategies: Early fusion, late fusion, ensemble methods
- Validation datasets: Hold-out test sets, expert-curated materials

**Method**:
1. Integrate experiments 1 & 2 into unified pipeline
2. Implement physics constraints (charge neutrality, stability criteria)
3. Multi-objective optimization for performance-cost trade-offs
4. Deploy via Streamlit interface for interactive exploration
5. Expert evaluation with materials scientists

**Success Metrics**:
- Overall system accuracy improvement over individual methods
- User satisfaction scores from materials scientist evaluations
- Novel material discovery rate (validated via literature search)
- Pipeline inference time < 1 second per query

## Expected Outcomes

**Optimistic Scenario**:
- Discover 5-10 novel cathode/anode compositions with predicted performance exceeding current standards
